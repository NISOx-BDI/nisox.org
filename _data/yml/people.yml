        Thomas Nichols is a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow in Basic Biomedical Science and the Professor of Neuroimaging Statistics at the Oxford Big Data Institute. He previously was a Professor in the Warwick Department of Statistics and WMG, and before that the Director of Modelling & Genetics at the GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Imaging Centre at Hammersmith Hospital in London, where he worked on statistical methods for fMRI in the context of clinical trials, and integrating genetic data into brain image analyses. Before coming to the UK he was an Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan, and in 2001 received his Ph.D. in statistics from Carnegie Mellon University where he also trained in cognitive neuroscience. He has been active in the field of functional neuroimaging since 1992, when he worked at the University of Pittsburgh's PET Center as a programmer and statistician. Dr. Nichols' research focuses on modelling and inference of neuroimaging data, including PET, fMRI & M/EEG.

        Petya comes from Bulgaria where she attended the National High School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. In 2011, Petya moved to Scotland to study at the University of Glasgow and in 2016 she successfully graduated Integrated Masters programme in Statistics with a year in industry. Working as an information analyst for a year in the National Health Service Scotland inspired her to do a DPhil in Statistics with application in public health. In particular, Petya is interested in Bayesian statistics and Genetics which led to her dissertation being focussed on identifying an appropriate model for correlated data suitable for data generated from experiments to study DNA methylation.

        Sam Davenport is a PhD student at the University of Oxford on the OxWaSP Program, supervised by Thomas Nichols and Chris Holmes. Sam is currently working on Selective Inference methods to correct for bias in fMRI that arising due to the Winner's Curse. He is also looking at methods for dealing with Missing Data. He did his undergraduate in Mathematics at Cambridge before going on to do the Part III mathematics masters course there specialising in Statistics. His masters dissertation was entitled "Statistical Analysis in Neuroimaging Structural Breaks" which involved identifying changes in the brain using bootstrapping techniques and looking at multiple hypothesis testing in tree structures.

        Han first graduated as a master of science in experimental psychology at Ghent University. He then obtained a master of science in Statistical Data Analysis at the same university. During this period, he did an internship on data-analytical stability of fMRI results. Furthermore, he worked on fitting Probabilistic Index Models on very large datasets. Currently, he is a PhD student at the department of Data Analysis at Ghent University. As his interests grew towards methodological research in neuroscience, he now focusses on meta-analytical models and procedures in fMRI data analysis. He tries to incorporate his findings and recommendations in a broader framework of reproducibility and reliability of neuroscience.

        Alex Bowring is a DPhil in Population Health student based in the Big Data Institute at the University of Oxford. His research is centred on functional MRI, with a particular focus on statistical methodology for neuroimaging analyses and developing open science practices. He is currently applying newly developed statistical methods to obtain precise confidence statements about where activation occurs in the brain for population neuroimaging studies, where thousands of subjects have been scanned. As well as this, he is also working on a software comparison project to understand the differences between the main neuroimaging software packages used for fMRI analyses.
